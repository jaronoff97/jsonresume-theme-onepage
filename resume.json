    "summary": "I'm a recent computer science graduate from Northeastern University, where I was heavily involved with tutoring, entrepreneurship, events and clubs. I was the president of Northeastern's NUHacks club - whose mission is to help students make, break, hack, design, build and other creative-type things, which is a mission near and dear to my heart. Outside of school, I was a hackNY fellow in 2017, and a mentor in 2018, and I will talk nonstop about how much i loved those experiences. I have also been the hackathon director for hackNY since 2018, running many hackathons and coordinating other events.\nWhile in college, I worked for two years (non-consecutively) at Datadog in NYC as a Software Engineering intern on the alerting team. I was responsible for writing high-availability distributed systems in Golang and Python, and was heavily involved in building the company culture as well as incident response. In 2019, I became a co-op at Drift in Boston, where I worked as an SRE on implementing many of the best-practices I had learned at Datadog â€“ including implementing canary deployments, autogenerated alerts and dashboards, and improved configuration. I accepted a full time offer at Drift, and worked part time through my final semesters at college. I was one of the leaders for the company's kubernetes migration, and was responsible for improving the reliability of the core messaging platform, which has had 99.9999% uptime because of my work. I have also been leading the company in our migration to the Istio service mesh. Most recently, I've been working on revamping our on-call rotation and paging infrastructure to improve engineer QOL.
